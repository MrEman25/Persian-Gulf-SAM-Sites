# Persian Gulf Strategic Sites
Current real-to-life SAM and EWR sites for Iran and the UAE as well as Iranian Infrastructure I have deemed to be strategically important to Iran. 

This is a work in progress. 

All SAM batteries are placed with exact numbers of launcher for each site as they are in real life for Iran and the UAE/USA.

SAM sites may not have all necessary settings or control units place properly to fire and at this time only a few HAWK sites have been tested. Please let me know if this is the case as I am not 100% on how all DCS SAM sites work. 

I have placed all SAM sites within the detailed map areas only. These sites are based on actual IMINT. I have personally gone into Google Earth for each site to lay it out as true-to-life as possible down to number of launchers per site as well as the location and orientation for each launcher. Where HQ-2 sites are in real life, I am using HAWK batteries and where SA-2 sites are I am using s-300. These are the closest approximation to what we have in DCS currently (and the ranges are actually pretty close from what I've researched). I've also placed triggers as points of reference for empty but built up HAWK sites (also based on real intel). While these sites are currently inactive as of July 2018, with short notice they can be made operational if Iran's air defense branch deems necessary.

Sites of strategic importance will be added over time as further research is done. To start, I have currently marked the most important power production plants in the area and plan to expand further with sites such as military bases, barracks, and other similar sites. These sites are also marked with triggers in proper locations for mission makers to go in and add static buildings or whatever you would like.

Please feel free to to use and edit this to your desire. However, to keep things consistent I would ask that you do not re-upload or redistribute an edited version.

Also If someone would like to take what I'm working on and upload a MOOSE/MIST dynamic campaign with real Orders Of Battle, please contact me. I do not plan on uploading such a version by myself.

***Due to the fact that ED is not going to be expanding the map any further, I will also be making a version of this template using Tehran's and Esfehans air defenses for Shiraz and Kerman respectively. I will also add Tehran and Esfehan military infrastructure in those cities as well***
